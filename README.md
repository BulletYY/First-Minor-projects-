1. Streamlit App (Stock News Sentiment Tracker)
Components:
Streamlit App Setup:

The app is created using the Streamlit library.
It uses the openbb_terminal SDK to fetch financial news sentiment and related information.
User Input:

Users can input a stock ticker in a text input field.
Functionality:

The get_news_signal function is defined to retrieve the latest news article for the provided stock ticker.
The sentiment of the news article is then analyzed using the openbb SDK's text_sent function.
Depending on the sentiment score, the app displays a recommendation to buy, sell, or states that there's no useful signal.
The app also provides a link to the latest news article.
Workflow:
User inputs a stock ticker.
The app fetches the latest news article for that stock using the openbb.stocks.ba.cnews function.
The sentiment of the news article is analyzed using the openbb.stocks.ba.text_sent function.
The app displays a recommendation based on the sentiment score and provides a link to the news article.
2. Dash App (PCA on Stock Returns)
Components:
Dash App Setup:

The app is created using the Dash library with Bootstrap styling.
It also uses the openbb_terminal SDK for financial data retrieval.
User Input:

Users can input a list of stock tickers, choose the number of principal components for PCA, and select a date range.
Functionality:

The app performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the daily returns of the selected stocks.
It displays two graphs: a bar chart showing the explained variance by each principal component and a line chart showing the cumulative explained variance.
Workflow:
User inputs a list of stock tickers, selects the number of principal components, and chooses a date range.
On clicking the "Submit" button, the app fetches historical stock data for the specified tickers and date range using openbb.economy.index.
Daily returns are calculated, and PCA is applied using the sklearn.decomposition.PCA module.
The app generates two graphs - a bar chart showing explained variance by each component and a line chart showing cumulative explained variance.
