Mostly here I’m focused on econometrics—working through applied problems, 
brushing up on core concepts, and testing out different modeling approaches. 
Sometimes it’s just small experiments or replications, other times I’m digging into datasets to explore causal inference or time series stuff.
Keeping it hands-on and practical.
